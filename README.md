<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# FIT-NEZ

`Tech Stack and APIs`

The project utilizes the following technologies and APIs:

React
Express
OpenAI API

## Features and Usage Instructions

The project offers the following features:

Bulking or strength training: The application provides options for users to choose between bulking or strength training programs.

Meal Plan Generation: By making a call to the OpenAI API, the application generates a complete meal plan from Monday to Sunday. Users can view and select their desired meal plan.

Workout Video Selection: Users can choose a workout video from a list of available options. Clicking on the desired video will navigate them to the bottom of the page where the selected video will be ready for consumption.

Usage Instructions:

Start on the home page.
Select either "Bulk" or "Strength" training option.
Enter your metrics (e.g., weight, height) on the second page.
Send the metrics to the artificial intelligence system.
Choose a workout video from the provided list.
It will automatically scroll down to view and consume the selected video.

## Installation

To install the project in both developer and production environments, follow the steps below:
